    <h2>High Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Phase transitions: Allen–Cahn, Ginzburg–Landau, and computational phase-field analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02739v1">On stable solutions to the Allen-Cahn equation with bounded energy   density in $\mathbb{R}^4$</a> by Enric Florit-Simon, Joaquim Serra</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02389v1">Rigidity in the Ginzburg--Landau approximation of harmonic spheres</a> by Matilde Gianocca</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05339v1">A topological approach to the Cahn-Hilliard equation and hyperuniform   fields</a> by Abel H. G. Milor, Otto Sumray, Heather A. Harrington, Axel Voigt, Marco Salvalaglio</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: The Allen–Cahn result proves 1D symmetry for stable solutions (u:\mathbb{R}^4\to(-1,1)) under cubic-energy growth (E(B_R)=O(R^3)), a regime equivalent to bounded energy density; this directly strengthens the analytic underpinnings of the Allen–Cahn min–max approximation to minimal hypersurfaces in dimension (4) (e.g., multiplicity one and Morse index predictions of Marques–Neves), and yields robust curvature estimates for phase transitions. The GL rigidity theorem shows that among degree-one maps on (S^2), only rotations arise as limits of Ginzburg–Landau critical points with energy (&lt;8\pi-\gamma), a sharp obstruction that informs which harmonic maps can be realized via GL approximations—highly relevant for variational approximation schemes. The Cahn–Hilliard/TDA paper provides a quantitative pipeline (persistence diagrams, Wasserstein metrics) that respects known scaling and sharp-interface limits, offering practical diagnostics for numerical studies of interfaces and coarsening flows closely related to Allen–Cahn/Cahn–Hilliard dynamics. Together, these advances cut across theory and computation for phase-field models central to minimal-surface approximations:
[
E_{\mathrm{AC}}(u;\Omega)=\int_{\Omega}\tfrac12|\nabla u|^2+W(u)\,dx,\qquad E_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{GL}}(u)=\int_{S^2}\tfrac12|\nabla u|^2+\tfrac{(1-|u|^2)^2}{4\varepsilon^2}\,dS.
]</p>
<h3>Mean curvature flow: structure of cylindrical singular sets</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01707v1">Regularity of cylindrical singular sets of mean curvature flow</a> by Ao Sun, Zhihan Wang, Jinxin Xue</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: The authors show that the (k)-cylindrical singular set is locally contained in a (k)-dimensional (C^{2,\alpha})-submanifold after removing lower-dimensional parts, and that its curvature is determined by the asymptotic profile. The new (L^2)-distance non-concentration principle refines quantitative stratification near cylindrical models. This sharp structural control of ( \mathcal{S}^k ) is highly relevant to understanding singularities of mean curvature flow and their relation to min–max limits and blow-up analysis.</p>
<h3>GMT and rectifiability under anisotropic density controls</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02954v1">On the geometry of measures with density bounds in a Hölder   anisotropic setting</a> by Ignacio Tejeda</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Under anisotropic Hölder-convergent density ratios or doubling, the support is (C^{1,\gamma}) if sufficiently flat; without flatness, it decomposes into a (C^{1,\gamma}) (n)-manifold plus an ( \mathcal{H}^n )-null set. This is a strong anisotropic counterpart to Reifenberg/Preiss-type rectifiability and directly informs regularity expectations for anisotropic varifolds and interfacial energies common in minimal surface approximations and capillarity-type problems.</p>
<h3>Singularities in variational maps: nonunique tangent maps for minimizing (p)-harmonic maps</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02740v1">Nonunique tangent maps at isolated singularities of minimizing   $p$-harmonic maps</a> by Jonas Hirsch</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Provides the first example (for (p&lt;m\le n+2)) of a minimizing (p)-harmonic map with an isolated singularity admitting a continuum of distinct tangent maps, extending B. White’s stationary case for (p=2). This demonstrates intrinsic nonuniqueness at singular points even in minimizing settings, with implications for blow-up analysis, uniqueness of tangent cones, and fine stratification—phenomena parallel to challenges in GMT and MCF.</p>
<h3>Minimal and CMC hypersurfaces in sub-Riemannian geometry</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04972v1">The Classification of Rotationally symmetric hypersurfaces in the   Heisenberg groups $H_{n}$</a> by Hung-Lin Chiu, Sin-Hua Lai, Hsiao-Fan Liu</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Completes the classification of umbilic hypersurfaces in (H_n), characterizes generating curves for rotationally symmetric hypersurfaces with constant (p)-mean curvature (H=c) (including (H=0)), and proves an Alexandrov-type theorem in (H_n). This advances the theory of sub-Riemannian minimal and constant mean curvature hypersurfaces, dovetailing with interests in CMC/capillarity-type problems and geometric PDEs beyond the Riemannian setting.</p>
<h3>Classical minimal surfaces in (\mathbb{R}^3)</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03925v1">Higher genus Angel surfaces</a> by Rivu Bardhan, Indranil Biswas, Shoichi Fujimori, Pradip Kumar</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Establishes the existence, for all (p\ge1), of complete minimal surfaces in ( \mathbb{R}^3 ) of least total absolute curvature with two ends (one catenoidal, one Enneper-type), extending the Weber–Wolf orthodisk method via “partial symmetry.” These explicit constructions enrich the landscape of finite-total-curvature minimal surfaces and offer testbeds for index/multiplicity phenomena alongside min–max produced examples.</p>
<h2>Medium Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Nonlocal variational models and analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03468v1">Local boundary conditions in nonlocal hyperelasticity via heterogeneous   horizons</a> by Carolin Kreisbeck, Hidde Schönberger</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Develops Sobolev-type spaces for nonlocal gradients with space-dependent interaction ranges that vanish at the boundary, proving trace theorems and Poincaré inequalities and establishing existence of minimizers for quasiconvex/polyconvex integrands. The localization at the boundary connects nonlocal models with classical variational boundary value problems, offering tools potentially adaptable to nonlocal approximations of interfacial energies.</p>
<h3>Topological/differential tools with geometric flavor</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02802v1">On linking numbers and Biot-Savart kernels</a> by Daniel Cibotaru, Luciano Mari</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Constructs differential linking forms on 3-manifolds via heat-kernel based potentials and recovers Gauss’s linking formula in ( \mathbb{R}^3 ). The extendibility across blow-ups in codimension (1,3) (and (2) when (L) is minimal) touches the interface of differential topology and geometric analysis, with potential applications to flow lines and vortex filament models.</p>
<h3>Computational geometry of TPMS and bicontinuous structures</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02306v1">Transforming tubular packings to bicontinuous surfaces</a> by Vira Raichenko, Alicja Bukat, Michal Bykowski, Lucja Kowalewska, Myfanwy E. Evans</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Computationally demonstrates pathways from symmetric cylinder packings to triply-periodic minimal surfaces, relevant to biological membranes and materials. Offers geometric algorithms that could inform numerical constructions of TPMS and comparisons with minimal surface theory.</p>
<h3>Numerical conformal mapping on complex surfaces</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01978v1">The Conjugate Function Method for Surfaces with Elaborate Topological   Types</a> by H. Hakula, A. Rasila, Y. Zheng</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Refines the conjugate function method to multiply connected domains and Riemann surfaces using high-order FEM, enabling accurate conformal maps on domains with singular boundaries. While outside minimal-surface PDEs, the computational techniques might translate to high-accuracy solvers on complex geometries.</p>
<h3>Fully nonlinear elliptic PDE: small-perturbation and partial regularity</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01138v1">A generalization of Savin's small perturbation theorem for fully   nonlinear elliptic equations and applications</a> by Zhenyu Fan</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Extends Savin’s small-perturbation theorem to nonhomogeneous equations (F(D^2u,Du,u,x)=f) with Hölder-small coefficients/RHS and derives partial regularity for (\sigma_k(D^2u)=f). The perturbative framework is adjacent to regularity tools used across variational problems and could inform analogous small-excess schemes in geometric PDE.</p>
