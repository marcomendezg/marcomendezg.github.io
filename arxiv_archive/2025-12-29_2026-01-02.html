    <h2>High Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Mean Curvature Flow: Cylindrical singularities, ancient solutions, and structure theorems</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25050v1">The PDE-ODI principle and cylindrical mean curvature flows</a> by Richard H. Bamler, Yi Lai</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24524v1">Classification of ancient cylindrical mean curvature flows and the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture</a> by Richard H. Bamler, Yi Lai</li>
</ul>
<p>These two papers introduce a PDE-to-ODI mechanism that yields high-order asymptotics and a full classification of ancient asymptotically cylindrical flows, resolving the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture. Highlights include uniqueness of the bowl translator (\times \mathbb{R}^m) under a dominant linear mode, complete asymptotic expansions under a dominant quadratic mode, and a canonical neighborhood theorem near multiplicity-one cylindrical singularities. The approach bypasses the Łojasiewicz–Simon inequality and unifies classical results (e.g., uniqueness of tangent flows and rigidity of cylinders), which should directly inform analysis of singularity models for minimal hypersurfaces via flow methods and sharpen spectral-mode-based stability/instability mechanisms around cylinders (S^k \times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}).</p>
<h3>Translators and fully nonlinear curvature flows</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23623v1">Rotationally symmetric translating solitons of fully nonlinear extrinsic geometric flows: Classification and Applications</a> by José Torres Santaella</li>
</ul>
<p>A systematic classification of rotationally symmetric translators for broad fully nonlinear flows, with fine asymptotics for bowl-type and catenoidal-type solutions and rigidity/uniqueness within graphical classes. The techniques parallel those for MCF translators and may transfer to stability, barrier, and gluing arguments in flows used to probe minimal-surface singularities and variational limits.</p>
<h3>Geometric Measure Theory: Minimal hypersurfaces with fractal singular sets</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24859v1">On a conjecture of Almgren II: area-minimizing submanifolds with fractal singular sets on almost any manifold</a> by Zhenhua Liu</li>
</ul>
<p>Completes a two-part resolution of Almgren’s conjecture by building area-minimizing submanifolds with fractal singular sets on “almost any” smooth manifold. This expands the landscape of permissible singular behaviors in GMT and calibrations, sharpening expectations for min-max limits and Allen–Cahn approximations where the structure and dimension of singular sets are central.</p>
<h3>Allen–Cahn and interface limits</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24610v1">Half-space minimizing solutions of a two dimensional Allen-Cahn system</a> by Zhiyuan Geng</li>
</ul>
<p>Classifies half-space minimizing solutions for a multi-well vectorial Allen–Cahn system in (\mathbb{R}^2_+) via blow-down limits and describes sharp-interface asymptotics near transition layers. Directly relevant to capillarity/half-space boundary problems and to understanding how boundary conditions imprint on varifold limits of phase-field minimizers.</p>
<h3>Phase-field dynamics: Cahn–Hilliard–Gurtin with general boundary conditions</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23582v2">The Time-Periodic Cahn-Hilliard-Gurtin System on the Half Space as a Mixed-Order System with General Boundary Conditions</a> by Guillaume Neuttiens, Jonas Sauer</li>
</ul>
<p>Establishes well-posedness and maximal regularity for time-periodic CH–Gurtin on a half-space via a new class of complementing boundary conditions extending Lopatinskiĭ–Shapiro to mixed-order systems. Offers a robust framework for boundary-driven phase-field models, relevant for studying oscillatory forcing and boundary layers in phase-transition approximations to minimal surfaces.</p>
<h3>Degenerate fourth-order PDE: Thin-film equation regularity</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24809v1">Hölder continuity of weak solutions to the thin-film equation in (d=2)</a> by Federico Cornalba, Julian Fischer, Erika Maringová Kokavcová</li>
</ul>
<p>Proves Hölder regularity of energy-dissipating weak solutions in (d=2) using a hole-filling strategy adapted to degenerate fourth-order diffusion. While not directly a minimal-surface equation, the techniques enrich the toolbox for higher-order degenerate parabolic PDEs that arise in gradient flows of interfacial energies and thin-film/CH-type approximations.</p>
<h3>Variational micromagnetics: Bogomol’nyi regime and phase transitions</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24598v1">Phase transition thresholds and chiral magnetic fields of general degree</a> by Slim Ibrahim, Tatsuya Miura, Carlos Román, Ikkei Shimizu</li>
</ul>
<p>Determines minimal energies across all topological degrees in a Landau–Lifshitz functional with Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions, proving uniqueness in degrees (0) and (-1), nonexistence otherwise, and identifying new stability transitions. The variational structure and topological constraints parallel Ginzburg–Landau/Allen–Cahn paradigms and inform the study of skyrmion-like defects as geometric interfaces.</p>
<h3>Minimal surfaces in Lorentz–Minkowski space</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24908v1">A Liouville-Weierstrass correspondence for Spacelike and Timelike Minimal Surfaces in (\mathbb{L}^3)</a> by Adriana A. Cintra, Iury Domingos, Irene I. Onnis</li>
</ul>
<p>Builds a unified Weierstrass-type representation for spacelike/timelike minimal surfaces via solutions (\lambda) of (\Delta \lambda = -\varepsilon e^{-4\lambda}), linking pseudo-isometries to Möbius-type transformations. While Lorentzian, the representation-theoretic control of Gauss data and conformal factors resonates with classical minimal-surface theory and could inspire analogous constructions in geometric flows or capillarity with anisotropy.</p>
<h2>Medium Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Computational variational methods for Plateau-type energies</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24928v1">A finite element approach for minimizing line and surface energies arising in the study of singularities in liquid crystals</a> by Dominik Stantejsky</li>
</ul>
<p>ADMM-based finite elements for an energy mixing surface area, boundary length, and obstacle interactions. Offers implementable tools to explore capillarity-like problems with line tension and obstacles, potentially useful for simulating sharp-interface limits and saddle searches in min–max settings.</p>
<h3>Spectral/variational bounds on manifolds</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24725v1">Isocapacitary constants for the (p)-Laplacian on compact manifolds</a> by Lili Wang, Tao Wang</li>
</ul>
<p>Introduces Steklov/Neumann isocapacitary constants yielding two-sided bounds for ((p,\alpha))-Sobolev constants and first Steklov/Neumann eigenvalues. Techniques may inform geometric inequalities and trace-type bounds relevant to free boundary variational problems.</p>
<h3>Concentration phenomena and nonsmooth variational methods</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24234v1">Multi-bump solutions for sublinear elliptic equations with nonsymmetric coefficients</a> by Chengxiang Zhang, Xu Zhang</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23207v1">Infinitely many positive solutions to nonlinear scalar field equation with nonsmooth nonlinearity</a> by Tianhao Liu, Juncheng Wei, Wenming Zou</li>
</ul>
<p>Develop methods for constructing many-bump solutions in settings with sublinear or logarithmic (nonsmooth) nonlinearities, using localized variational frameworks and nonsmooth critical point theory. The separation/control of bumps and max–min arguments parallel gluing/compactness themes that appear in phase-transition models approximating minimal surfaces.</p>
<h3>Nonlinear Schrödinger on graphs and dimensional reduction</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23321v1">Normalized solutions of nonlinear magnetic Schrödinger equations on metric graphs</a> by Pietro d'Avenia, Zhentao He, Chao Ji</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23286v1">Ground States for the Nonlinear Schr{ö}dinger Equation on Open Books and Dimensional Reduction to Metric Graphs</a> by Stefan Le Coz, Boris Shakarov</li>
</ul>
<p>Presents existence/multiplicity of mass-constrained solutions on graphs with magnetic effects and shows sharp thresholds for when 2D “open book” ground states reduce to graph states. While PDEs differ from geometric flows, the constrained minimization and dimensional reduction ideas echo techniques in reduced models for interfaces.</p>
<h3>TDA and sampling geometry</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23225v1">On topology estimation of submanifolds in Riemannian manifolds by random points</a> by Reza Mirzaie</li>
</ul>
<p>Provides recovery guarantees for the topology of a compact submanifold from random samples under curvature assumptions. Relevant to computational geometry aspects of minimal-surface inference and data-driven exploration of geometric configuration spaces.</p>
