    <h2>High Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Geometric flows (mean curvature flow and variants, including hyperbolic setting and free boundary)</h3>
<p>These works develop tools and rigidity for curvature-driven evolutions that are central to min-max, singularity analysis, and comparison-principle techniques. Of particular note: Aleksandrov reflection for level-set flows in hyperbolic space and rigidity/parametrization of ancient free-boundary solutions around unstable free-boundary minimal hypersurfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12186v1">Aleksandrov reflection for Geometric Flows in Hyperbolic Spaces</a> by Theodora Bourni, José M. Espinar, Aakash Mishra</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11930v1">Modified mean curvature flow of graphs in Riemannian manifolds</a> by Jocel Faustino Norberto de Oliveira, Jorge Herbert Soares de Lira, Matheus Nunes Soares</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08850v1">Ancient solutions to free boundary mean curvature flow</a> by Theodora Bourni, Giada Franz</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09806v1">Convergence to pushed fronts and the behavior of level sets in monostable reaction-diffusion equations</a> by Ryo Kiyono</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters:
- Hyperbolic-space Aleksandrov reflection in level-set formulation yields starshapedness and exponential convergence to umbilic limits at infinity, aligning with interest in hyperbolic (3)-manifolds and IMCF.
- A priori height/gradient/curvature estimates for modified MCF of graphs (with a Killing field) strengthen long-time existence frameworks useful in barrier constructions.
- The free-boundary ancient solution rigidity and the index–parameter correspondence clarify the landscape of ancient solutions emanating from unstable free-boundary minimal hypersurfaces, informing stability/instability analyses.
- The pushed-front convergence with an effective mean curvature flow with drift connects reaction-diffusion front geometry to motion by mean curvature, supplying a bridge to geometric front laws.</p>
<h3>Mean curvature equation: stability, regularity, and Liouville theorems</h3>
<p>New inner regularity and sharp interior gradient estimates for solutions to the prescribed mean curvature equation strengthen the analytic toolkit around minimal/CMC graphs, with direct implications for rigidity and uniform ellipticity away from critical sets.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12001v1">Inner regularity and Liouville theorems for stable solutions to the mean curvature equation</a> by Fanheng Xu</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11991v1">Improved Interior Gradient Estimates for the Mean Curvature Equation under Nonlinear Assumptions</a> by Fanheng Xu</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters:
- Optimal Morrey-type regularity for (\nabla u) of stable solutions and Liouville results under quantified decay sharpen stability-based rigidity in dimensions (2\le n\le 10), echoing classical minimal surface theory.
- Oscillation-based gradient bounds for (\mathrm{div}!\left(\nabla u/\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}\right)=f(\nabla u)) (including (f=0) and IMCF regularizations) yield uniform ellipticity away from the critical set and affine rigidity for global solutions with at-most-linear growth.</p>
<h3>Phase-field and sharp-interface limits (Allen–Cahn and variants)</h3>
<p>A matrix-valued Allen–Cahn model is shown to converge to a geometric sharp-interface limit via modulated energy, expanding phase-field approximations beyond scalar multi-well potentials and avoiding spectral analysis of linearized operators.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11485v1">The sharp interface limit of the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation</a> by Xingyu Wang</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters:
- Provides a robust weak-convergence route to interface evolution and constructs weak solutions to the limiting harmonic heat flow with mixed boundary conditions—relevant to phase-field approaches approximating minimal surfaces and curvature-driven flows.</p>
<h3>Variational approximations to Plateau/minimal surfaces</h3>
<p>Existence and Hölder regularity for minimizers of a Plateau-approximation functional generalize Steiner-type approximations to higher-dimensional surfaces, contributing to computational and variational approaches to minimal surfaces.</p>
<ul>

<p>Construction of nontrivial self-expanding solutions emanating from non-energy-minimizing (0)-homogeneous data into hemispheres, with infinitely many weak solutions satisfying monotonicity.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08932v1">Existence of expanding harmonic map flows to hemispheres</a> by Xuanyu Li</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters:
- Establishes existence/non-uniqueness in an expanding regime with parabolic monotonicity, echoing themes in geometric flows (e.g., self-expanders in MCF) and providing testbeds for blow-up/continuation scenarios.</p>
<h3>Sub-Riemannian and mixed local–nonlocal elliptic regularity</h3>
<p>Regularity in the Heisenberg group for mixed local/nonlocal degenerate equations enhances the analytic toolbox for geometric PDE in sub-Riemannian settings.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08398v2">(C^{1,α})-regularity for Mixed Local and Nonlocal Degenerate Elliptic Equations in the Heisenberg Group</a> by Junli Zhang</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters:
- Morrey-type iteration and Hölder-to-(C^{1,\alpha}) upgrades in (\mathbb{H}^n) inform regularity questions for nonlocal energies and variational problems on sub-Riemannian manifolds, relevant to non-Euclidean GMT contexts.</p>
