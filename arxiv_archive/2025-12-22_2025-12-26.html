    <h2>High Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Free boundary and capillary minimal surfaces</h3>
<p>Capillary/free-boundary minimal surfaces in curved ambient spaces remain a core testing ground for variational and index methods. The paper below develops monotonicity and index characterizations in (\mathbb{S}^3), paralleling classical results like Urbano’s theorem.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20857v1">Free boundary and capillary minimal surfaces in spherical caps II: Low energy</a> by Jonathan J. Zhu</p>
<h3>Mean curvature flow and geometric measure theory</h3>
<p>A new canonical space-time-Grassmann measure recasts Brakke flow as a space-time measure satisfying a distributional Brakke inequality. This refines measurability and tangential-structure tools (mean curvature vector, density, tangent maps), sharpening GMT foundations for analyzing singularities and blow-up in mean curvature flow.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19227v1">The space-time-Grassmann measure of the Brakke flow</a> by Yu Tong Liu, Myles Workman</p>
<h3>Variational and multiplicity methods for nonlinear elliptic PDE</h3>

<h3>Regularity and sharp analytic inequalities for elliptic equations</h3>
<p>Sharper Calderón–Zygmund theory for (p)-systems with BMO complex coefficients, quantitative Hölder exponents in the Krylov–Safonov/Evans–Krylov regime, and optimal Hardy-weights for Finsler (p)-energies strengthen the analytic toolkit (monotonicity, blow-up, epsilon-regularity) used across GMT, minimal-surface approximations, and related semilinear models.

<h3>Gradient flows and asymptotics: Łojasiewicz–Simon, attractors, and degenerate parabolics</h3>
<p>Gradient-inequality and attractor methods provide robust convergence-to-equilibrium results for constrained/semi-linear flows and obstacle problems; degenerate parabolic supersolution frameworks give sharp decay. These techniques have strong analogies with tools used in Allen–Cahn/mean curvature flow asymptotics.

<h3>Chemotaxis and particle approximations</h3>
<p>A branching, moderately interacting particle system with singular kernel approximates Keller–Segel with logistic damping and quantitatively suppresses blow-up, with an explicit rate (N^{-\frac{1}{2(d+1)}}). This bridges stochastic particle methods and PDE gradient flows in (\mathcal{P}_2), informing computational strategies.
