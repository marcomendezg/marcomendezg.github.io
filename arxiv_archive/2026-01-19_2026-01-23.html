    <h2>High Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Phase-field, Cahn–Hilliard, and Ginzburg–Landau dynamics</h3>
<p>These works push tools central to phase-transition approximations of minimal surfaces (e.g., Allen–Cahn/Cahn–Hilliard), with implications for coarsening, stochastic effects, and asymptotic reductions. They inform both analytical and computational study of diffuse-interface energies approximating area/curvature functionals.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16145v1">On the Ginzburg-Landau approximation for quasilinear pattern forming reaction-diffusion-advection systems</a> by Théo Belin, Guido Schneider
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15134v1">A New Measure of Coarseness for Solutions to Cahn--Hilliard Equations</a> by Peter Howard, Adam Larios, Quyuan Lin
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14428v1">The stochastic nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with regular potential and multiplicative noise</a> by Andrea Di Primio, Christoph Hurm
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13293v1">Long-time behavior of solutions to fluid dynamic shape optimization problems via phase-field method</a> by Michael Hinze, Christian Kahle, John Sebastian H. Simon
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12653v1">A Landau-de Gennes Type Theory for Cholesteric-Helical Smectic-Smectic C* Liquid Crystal Phase Transitions</a> by Apala Majumdar, Baoming Shi, Dawei Wu, Jingmin Xia, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Why relevant: rigorous GL reductions near first instabilities refine the use of amplitude equations for pattern formation; new coarsening metrics complement (\Gamma)-limit heuristics for (\int_\Omega \epsilon|\nabla u|^2 + \epsilon^{-1}W(u)\,dx); stochastic CH with nonlocal kernels provides well-posedness and nonlocal-to-local rates, relevant to noisy phase-field approximations of minimal surfaces; phase-field shape optimization gives convergence to stationary minimizers as time (\to\infty); the LdG analysis parallels variational bifurcation/limit regimes familiar from Allen–Cahn.</p>
<h3>Mean curvature and related curvature flows</h3>
<p>Progress on quantitative/qualitative structure of flows central to variational geometry, including genus monotonicity, Harnack inequalities without convexity, and capillary curvature flows with convergence to stationary capillary data.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13787v1">The Genus-Decreasing Property of Mean Curvature Flow, I</a> by Brian White
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13767v1">The Harnack inequality without convexity for curve shortening flow</a> by Arjun Sobnack, Peter M. Topping
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14659v1">Capillary Orlicz-Minkowski flow in the upper half-space</a> by Guanghan Li, Chenyang Liu</p>
<p>Why relevant: genus monotonicity under mean curvature flow in (3)-manifolds (with controlled singularities) connects to topological simplification in min-max constructions; a convexity-free Harnack inequality for curve shortening refines curvature control and delayed regularity mechanisms; the capillary Orlicz–Minkowski flow (anisotropic Gauss curvature with boundary angle) yields existence for a capillary Minkowski-type problem via convergence of a geometric flow.</p>
<h3>Minimal/CMC surfaces, free boundary, and anisotropy</h3>
<p>Results on Liouville-type rigidity, free-boundary contact angles, and volume formulas for periodic CMC surfaces, with an isoperimetric counterexample in (\mathbb{T}^2 \times \mathbb{R}).
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15788v1">A half-space Liouville theorem for anisotropic minimal graph with free boundary</a> by Guofang Wang, Wei Wei, Chao Xia, Xuwen Zhang
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14935v1">The Enclosed Volume for Periodic Constant Mean Curvature Surfaces</a> by Lynn Heller, Sebastian Heller, Martin Traizet
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13101v1">Parallel mean curvature surfaces with constant contact angle along free boundaries</a> by Rui Gao, Miaomiao Zhu</p>
<p>Why relevant: an anisotropic half-space Liouville theorem (free boundary, one-sided linear growth) extends Bombieri–De Giorgi–Miranda/Simon rigidity to capillary settings; the new volume formula for periodic CMC surfaces via flat-connection curvature terms generalizes Minkowski and produces a striking isoperimetric counterexample in (\mathbb{T}^2 \times \mathbb{R}); classification and codimension-reduction for parallel mean curvature immersions with non-orthogonal boundary angle, including explicit branched minimal examples, speak directly to capillary/free-boundary geometry.</p>
<h3>Variational elliptic PDE: structure, multiplicity, and free boundaries</h3>
<p>Semilinear frameworks and free-boundary variational problems with tools transferable to Allen–Cahn-type energies and minimal-surface approximations.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14581v1">Global solution curves in harmonic parameters, and multiplicity of solutions</a> by Philip Korman
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13771v1">Existence and regularity of minimizers for a variational problem of species population density</a> by Pu-Zhao Kow, Masato Kimura, Hiroshi Ohtsuka
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12732v1">On a class of logarithmic Schrödinger equations via perturbation method</a> by Chen Huang, Zhipeng Yang</p>
<p>Why relevant: harmonic-parameter continuation of solution branches for (\Delta u+g(u)=f) clarifies multiplicity/turning behavior under (g'(u)&lt;\lambda_2), mirroring bifurcation for phase-field functionals; the population-density variational model yields existence/regularity and a free-boundary “saturated region,” paralleling obstacle-type analyses; perturbative variational methods for logarithmic Schrödinger equations handle non-(C^1) energies, adding techniques useful for nonsmooth potentials.</p>
<h3>Singularity formation and blow-up in diffusive systems</h3>
<p>Precise macroscopic blow-up profiles and two-sided estimates for chemotaxis sharpen tools for studying singularity formation in geometric PDE via analogous similarity and monotonicity methods.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14469v1">Sharp macroscopic blow-up behavior for the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system in dimensions (n\ge 3)</a> by Loth Damagui Chabi, Philippe Souplet</p>
<p>Why relevant: the identification of a nonflat backward self-similar profile (U) with (u(x,t)=(1+o(1))U(x,t)) as ((x,t)\to(0,T)), together with two-sided global bounds (C_1\le (T-t+|x|^2)u(x,t)\le C_2), offers a paradigm for macroscopic blow-up descriptions akin to tangent-flow analyses in mean curvature flow.</p>
<h2>Medium Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Harmonic maps and symmetry</h3>
<p>Equivariant frameworks and regular-singular ODE systems for harmonic maps on cohomogeneity-one manifolds inform symmetry-reduced approaches that sometimes parallel min-max or flow-based constructions.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15022v1">The Initial Value Problem for Harmonic maps of Cohomogeneity One manifolds</a> by Anna Siffert</p>
<p>Why relevant: local existence near a singular orbit for equivariant harmonic maps provides a controlled ODE–PDE bridge; while not directly about minimal surfaces, the techniques resonate with symmetry-reduced variational problems and regular-singular analysis.</p>
