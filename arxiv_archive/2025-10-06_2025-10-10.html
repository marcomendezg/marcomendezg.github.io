    <h2>High Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Mean Curvature Flow and Phase-Field Approaches</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09383v2">Existence of martingale solutions for a stochastic weighted mean   curvature flow of graphs</a> by Qi Yan, Xiang-Dong Li</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06979v2">Non-uniqueness in Mean Curvature Flow: Non-canonical solutions via the   parabolic Allen--Cahn</a> by J. M. Daniels-Holgate</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: These works push weak/measure-valued formulations of MCF. Yan–Li construct martingale solutions for a stochastic weighted graphical MCF, relevant for gradient-flow structures under noise and for understanding selection principles. Daniels-Holgate gives the first closed, non-trivial, non-canonical integral Brakke motions strictly inside the fattening set, obtained as limits of parabolic Allen–Cahn (u_t=\varepsilon \Delta u-\varepsilon^{-1}W'(u)). This decisively connects phase-field approximations to the landscape of weak MCF beyond the “outermost” solutions, and provides flows starting from very rough (Reifenberg/fractal) data.</p>
<h3>Curvature Flows Beyond MCF (Gauss, Inverse, Anisotropic)</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05614v1">Ancient Gauss Curvature Flows of Bounded Width</a> by Beomjun Choi, Kyeongsu Choi, Dongjun Noh</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08168v1">Asymptotic behaviour of the weak inverse anisotropic mean curvature flow</a> by Chaoqun Gao, Yong Wei, Rong Zhou</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04566v1">Inverse curvature flow of closed Legendre curves</a> by Takashi Kagaya, Masatomo Takahashi</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Choi–Choi–Noh construct new ancient compact solutions to Gauss curvature flow (pancake-with-flat sides in a slab; sausage-like for (\alpha)-GCF with (\alpha&gt;\tfrac12)), enriching the catalog of ancient profiles useful as models for singularities. Gao–Wei–Zhou establish (p)-harmonic gradient bounds uniform as (p\to 1), yielding local estimates for weak IAMCF and proving convergence to expanding Wulff shapes, extending Huisken–Ilmanen to anisotropy. Kagaya–Takahashi analyze inverse curvature flow for (\ell)-convex Legendre curves, proving global existence and complete classification of asymptotics toward self-similar solutions—illuminating inverse flows with singular features (cusps) in a tractable 1D geometric setting.</p>
<h3>Free-Boundary and Partition Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09875v1">Vectorial Bernoulli Problems and Free Boundary Systems</a> by Giorgio Tortone, Bozhidar Velichkov</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08241v1">A survey on the optimal partition problem</a> by Roberto Ognibene, Bozhidar Velichkov</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08670v1">Hausdorff dimension of the singular set for Griffith almost-minimizers   in the plane</a> by Manuel Friedrich, Camille Labourie, Kerrek Stinson</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: These surveys and results consolidate techniques central to variational free-boundary GMT. Tortone–Velichkov and Ognibene–Velichkov cover vectorial Bernoulli/optimal partitions, where interfaces realize multi-phase minimal boundaries and carry rich regularity/free-boundary structure. Friedrich–Labourie–Stinson show planar Griffith cracks are uniformly rectifiable and that the singular set has Hausdorff dimension (&lt;1); they also obtain higher integrability—an analogue of De Giorgi’s conjecture in the Mumford–Shah setting—relevant to understanding singularities of variational fracture akin to minimal partition boundaries.</p>
<h3>Geometric Measure Theory: Currents, Varifolds, Function Spaces</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08360v1">The Space-Time Connectivity Theorem for Normal Currents</a> by Paolo Bonicatto, Filip Rindler, Harry Turnbull</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05639v1">Young functions on varifolds. Part I. Functional analytic foundations</a> by Hsin-Chuang Chou</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Bonicatto–Rindler–Turnbull establish a space-time connectivity theorem for normal currents, producing a time-parametrized connecting current witnessing weak* convergence—an important tool for dynamic compactness and deformation arguments in GMT and for interpolating approximations that arise in min–max/flow limits. Chou develops functional-analytic foundations for “Young functions” on varifolds, giving a compactness framework to study convergence of pairs (surface, function) via graph measures—useful for coupling geometric objects with fields (e.g., Allen–Cahn order parameters on varifolds).</p>
<h3>Calculus of Variations: Relaxation and Non-Convex Energies</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07085v1">Relaxation of Non-Convex Integral Functionals in the Multidimensional   Scalar Case</a> by Tommaso Bertin, Paulin Huguet</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: A precise characterization of the lower semicontinuous envelope of non-convex integral functionals (E<a href="u">f</a>=\int_{\Omega} f(x,u,\nabla u)\,dx) under various topologies with fixed Lipschitz boundary data. The mechanisms preventing the Lavrentiev phenomenon here are directly applicable to phase-field/Allen–Cahn-type energies and to establishing robust (\Gamma)-limits underlying min–max approximations of minimal hypersurfaces.</p>
<h3>Minimal Surfaces and Comparison Geometry</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04481v1">Minimal surfaces and comparison geometry</a> by Otis Chodosh</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: A concise perspective on how minimal surface theory yields sharp comparison results—resonant with current min–max techniques and rigidity/structure theorems linking scalar curvature, topology, and minimal hypersurfaces.</p>
<h3>Isoperimetric and Multi-Bubble Geometry</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07078v1">Multi-Bubble Isoperimetric Problems</a> by Emanuel Milman</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Survey of characterization and stability for multi-bubble isoperimetric partitions, i.e., minimal clusters. Strong ties to GMT regularity and quantitative stability of minimal interfaces; fertile ground for adapting min–max and monotonicity tools to multi-phase settings.</p>
<h3>Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05627v1">Volume functions and boundary data of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds</a> by Jean-Marc Schlenker</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Reviews the interplay between boundary data and renormalized volume for convex co-compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds, framed by first-variation formulas where “conjugate” boundary variables govern (\delta \text{Vol}). This informs extremality/variational problems in (\mathbb{H}^3), with implications for minimal/CMC surfaces sitting in convex cores.</p>
<h3>Hermitian Curvature Flow on Lie Groups</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08846v1">Positive Hermitian curvature flow on 2-step nilpotent Lie groups</a> by Ettore Lo Giudice</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Long-time existence, convergence (after rescaling), and uniqueness of semi-algebraic solitons for positive Hermitian curvature flow under structural assumptions. While in complex/non-Kähler geometry, the flow techniques (Cheeger–Gromov limits, solitons) mirror tools in geometric flows relevant to MCF/CMC problems.</p>
<h2>Medium Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Phase-Field and Gradient-Flow PDEs</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08287v1">On the Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonlinear diffusion: the non-convex   case</a> by Monica Conti, Stefania Gatti, Andrea Giorgini, Giulio Schimperna</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07149v1">Derivation of the fourth-order DLSS equation with nonlinear mobility via   chemical reactions</a> by Alexander Mielke, André Schlichting, Artur Stephan</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Advances in non-convex gradient flows: well-posedness/long-time dynamics for Cahn–Hilliard with nonlinear diffusion using a tailored Łojasiewicz–Simon inequality, and a thermodynamically consistent derivation of DLSS with power-law mobilities via EDP convergence. These sharpen tools for analyzing phase-field approximations to interfacial flows.</p>
<h3>Inequalities for Submanifolds (Willmore-type and Sobolev)</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08053v1">Fenchel-Willmore and Sobolev-type inequalities for submanifolds in   non-negatively curved manifolds</a> by Meng Ji, Kwok-Kun Kwong</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Links a Fenchel–Willmore-type inequality to logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for mean-convex submanifolds with Euclidean volume growth, extending to boundaries and complete non-compact cases. Potential applications to curvature estimates and rigidity for surfaces/hypersurfaces.</p>
<h3>Nonlocal and Relaxation Methods in Variational Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04881v1">Riesz fractional gradient functionals defined on partitions:   nonlocal-to-local variational limits</a> by Stefano Almi, Maicol Caponi, Manuel Friedrich, Francesco Solombrino</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04672v1">Relaxation of quasi-convex functionals with variable exponent growth</a> by Giacomo Bertazzoni, Petteri Harjulehto, Peter Hästö, Elvira Zappale</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Almi–Caponi–Friedrich–Solombrino establish (\Gamma)-limits as (s\to 1) for linear-growth functionals of the Riesz (s)-fractional gradient on partitions (piecewise constants), informing nonlocal approximations of interfacial energies. Bertazzoni et al. provide relaxation for quasi-convex integrals with variable-exponent growth in BV-type spaces, with a precise decomposition into absolutely continuous/singular parts via recession functions—useful in heterogeneous media models.</p>
<h3>Mixed Local/Nonlocal Elliptic Problems with Hardy Potential</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04763v1">Asymptotic behaviour and existence of positive solutions for mixed local   nonlocal elliptic equations with Hardy potential</a> by Shammi Malhotra, Sarika Goyal, K. Sreenadh</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Variational and multiplicity results for equations driven by (-\Delta + (-\Delta)^s - \mu |x|^{-2}) with critical nonlinearity; asymptotic profile control via transformations. Techniques may transfer to hybrid local/nonlocal energies used to approximate area-like functionals.</p>
<h3>Spectral Geometry and Shape Optimization</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05732v1">A contractible Schiffer counterexample on the half-sphere</a> by Gonzalo Cao-Labora, Antonio J. Fernández</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Contractible domains on (\mathbb{S}^2_+) with Neumann eigenfunctions constant on the boundary via bifurcation and computer-assisted proof. While spectral, the bifurcation/shape-analysis machinery echoes variational strategies for capillarity and free-boundary problems.</p>
<h3>Mechanics of Thin Surfaces</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04821v1">Geometric Mechanics of Thin Periodic Surfaces</a> by Wenqian Sun, Yanxin Feng, Christian D. Santangelo, D. Zeb Rocklin</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: A geometric duality between isometric rotations and in-plane stress for periodically patterned thin sheets, with symplectic constraints on accessible isometries. Offers geometric insight relevant to modeling bending-dominated limits resembling minimal/CMC patterns in engineered metasurfaces.</p>
<h3>Information Geometry on Lie Groups</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04442v1">The moduli spaces of left-invariant statistical structures on Lie groups</a> by Hikozo Kobayashi, Yu Ohno, Takayuki Okuda, Hiroshi Tamaru</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Classification and moduli for left-invariant statistical (dually flat/Hessian) structures. Though outside core themes, it highlights differential-geometric moduli analysis techniques that sometimes parallel those in geometric flows and variational geometry.</p>
