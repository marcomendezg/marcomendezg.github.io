    <h2>High Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Mean Curvature Flow: singularities, self-similarity, and multiphase junctions</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05077v1">Mean curvature flow near a peanut solution</a> by Sigurd Angenent, Panagiota Daskalopoulos, Natasa Sesum</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02578v1">Self-Expanding Solutions to the Mean Curvature Flow for Multiphase Surfaces with Regular Junctions</a> by Wei-Hung Liao</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: The first paper analyzes instability near the “peanut” ancient-type solutions exhibiting degenerate neckpinches with cylindrical tangent flows yet Bowl-soliton pointed blow-ups; it establishes strong instability toward either spherical singularities or nondegenerate neckpinches and shows rescaled convergence to ancient ovals. This directly informs the landscape of singularities and selection mechanisms in MCF. The second constructs self-expanders for multiphase interfaces with regular triple junctions and emergent quadruple points at approximately (109.5^\circ) (tetrahedral angle), relevant to varifold/interface-network models and to phase-field approximations of MCF with junction conditions.</p>
<h3>Calibrations, minimal cones, and obstructions</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04789v1">Detect duality obstruction of calibrations in smooth category</a> by Yongsheng Zhang</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Advances gluing for calibration pairs and shows Lawlor cones admit coflat calibrations singular only at the origin while many cannot be smoothly calibrated. This sharpens when minimal cones are area-minimizing via calibration and clarifies smooth-versus-singular calibration obstructions—key to understanding minimality and regularity of singular minimal submanifolds.</p>
<h3>Phase-field energies and variational flows (Ginzburg–Landau, Cahn–Hilliard)</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01545v1">Existence and Nonlocal-to-Local Convergence for Singular, Anisotropic Nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard Equations</a> by Helmut Abels, Yutaka Terasawa</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01506v1">Mountain pass for the Ginzburg-Landau energy in a strip: solitons and solitonic vortices</a> by Amandine Aftalion, Luc Nguyen</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Abels–Terasawa prove existence and nonlocal-to-local convergence to anisotropic Cahn–Hilliard limits, aligning with (\Gamma)-convergence intuition for phase-field approximations of interfacial dynamics and anisotropic surface energies. Aftalion–Nguyen identify mountain-pass critical points of the Ginzburg–Landau energy exhibiting a transition from 1D solitons to solitonic vortices as strip width crosses a threshold—offering a clean variational bifurcation picture analogous to energy barriers in vortex nucleation and with clear min–max structure.</p>
<h3>Min-max and critical-point theory for nonlinear elliptic problems</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02229v1">An infinite-dimensional mountain pass theorem with applications to nonlinear elliptic systems</a> by Ablanvi Songo, Fabrice Colin</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01931v1">Prescribed energy solutions of concave-convex type problems involving sign-changing or vanishing weights</a> by Kanishka Perera, Humberto Ramos Quoirin, Kaye Silva</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Songo–Colin extend Rabinowitz’s mountain pass to an infinite-dimensional setting suited to systems, broadening the min–max toolkit. Perera–Ramos Quoirin–Silva develop an “energy-prescribed” critical point framework for concave–convex problems with sign-changing weights, yielding existence, multiplicity, and bifurcation results for ( \Phi'<em>\lambda(u)=0 ) at prescribed levels ( \Phi</em>\lambda(u)=c ). Both strengthen variational methods that often underlie min–max constructions of critical points modeling interfaces.</p>
<h3>Regularity and sharp inequalities in the calculus of variations</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04281v1">Regularity for minimizers of degenerate, non-autonomous, orthotropic integral functionals</a> by Antonio Giuseppe Grimaldi, Stefania Russo</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02784v1">Martingales, laminates and minimal Korn inequalities</a> by Gabriele Cassese</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Grimaldi–Russo establish higher differentiability for minimizers of anisotropic functionals ( \mathcal{F}(u,\Omega)=\sum_{i=1}^n \tfrac{1}{p_i}\int_\Omega a_i(x)|u_{x_i}|^{p_i}dx - \int_\Omega \omega(x)u(x)dx ), strengthening regularity under non-autonomous orthotropy—useful where anisotropy models crystalline energies. Cassese relates Korn-type inequalities to rank-one convexity/quasiconvexity via laminates and martingales, proving sharp bounds
[
N(d,\Omega)=2d(1-o(1)), \quad N'(d,\Omega)=2d-1,
]
and giving streamlined proofs of Ornstein-type non-inequalities. These tools inform coercivity and compactness central to variational problems.</p>
<h3>Variational PDE on discrete structures</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02881v1">Ground state solutions of (p)-Laplacian equations with nonnegative potentials on Lattice graphs</a> by Xinrong Zhao</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Uses the Nehari manifold and symmetry to obtain ground states and multiplicity for discrete (p)-Laplacian equations on (\mathbb{Z}^N) and Cayley graphs. While discrete, the variational architecture mirrors continuous settings and is relevant for numerical/graph approximations of semilinear elliptic models.</p>
<h2>Medium Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Extensions of variational methods and nonstandard settings</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05055v1">A Nehari manifold method for nonvariational problems</a> by Radu Precup, Andrei Stan</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04640v1">Critical concave-convex problems in Carnot group</a> by Mattia Galeotti, Eugenio Vecchi</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Extends Nehari manifold techniques to fixed-point (nonvariational) frameworks and adapts concave–convex variational methods to Carnot groups; both broaden applicability of min–max/Nehari ideas beyond the standard Euclidean elliptic setting.</p>
<h3>Aggregation, nonlocal-to-local limits, and collective dynamics</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03185v1">Nonlinear diffusion limit of non-local interactions on a sphere</a> by Mark A. Peletier, Anna Shalova</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02800v1">Swarming by curvature control in arbitrary dimension</a> by Pierre Degond, Antoine Diez, Amic Frouvelle</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Peletier–Shalova derive porous-medium-type diffusion as a limit of spherical aggregation with competing kernels, using variational and harmonic-analysis tools; Degond–Diez–Frouvelle develop hydrodynamic limits for a curvature-controlled alignment model via generalized collision invariants. Methods resonate with gradient-flow and kinetic-to-fluid techniques.</p>
<h3>Geometry of spaces of immersions</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01566v1">Completeness of reparametrization-invariant Sobolev metrics on the space of surfaces</a> by Martin Bauer, Cy Maor, Benedikt Wirth</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Proves metric/geodesic completeness and existence of minimizing geodesics for Sobolev-type metrics on the manifold of immersed surfaces, via a general completeness criterion and Michael–Simon–Sobolev estimates—useful background for geometric PDE on shape spaces.</p>
<h3>Optimal transport on nearly spherical manifolds</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01496v1">A Generalization of Caffarelli's Contraction Theorem to Nearly Spherical Manifolds</a> by Yuxin Ge, Jordan Serres</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Establishes volume-preserving Brenier–McCann maps realizing nearly round manifolds as images of ( \mathbb{S}^n ), extending contraction/stability results and yielding a perturbative form of Milman’s conjecture; techniques intersect geometric analysis and stability estimates.</p>
<h3>Geometry of neural representations and geometric ML</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04310v1">RNNs perform task computations by dynamically warping neural representations</a> by Arthur Pellegrino, Angus Chadwick</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01151v1">Fiber Bundle Networks: A Geometric Machine Learning Paradigm</a> by Dong Liu</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: A Riemannian framework for time-varying representational geometry in RNNs (dynamic warping) and a fiber-bundle-based classification architecture with learned metrics and variational prototype energies connect geometric ideas to interpretable ML.</p>
<h3>Surveys and adjacent geometric analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03012v2">Note on Regularity theory for Nonlinear elliptic equations</a> by Zhenye Qian</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01670v1">Horizon Data: Existence Results and a Near-Horizon Equation on General Null Hypersurfaces</a> by Miguel Manzano, Marc Mars</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01620v1">On the stability of Einstein metrics carrying a special twisted spinor</a> by Diego Artacho</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: A concise survey of core elliptic regularity (De Giorgi–Nash–Moser, Krylov–Safonov) plus works at the interface with geometric relativity and Einstein metric stability. While not directly tied to minimal surfaces, the analytic methods and stability themes are broadly relevant.</p>
