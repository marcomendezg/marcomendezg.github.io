    <h2>High Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Min-max theory: Morse index and enumerative results</h3>
<p>These works push core min-max machinery for minimal hypersurfaces. One bounds the Morse index of min-max critical varifolds realizing the (d)-dimensional (p)-width ( \omega_p^d(M) ), informing stability/instability and potential multiplicity; the other develops an enumerative framework relating the count of genus (g) minimal surfaces in positive Ricci curvature 3-manifolds to the topology of the space of embedded surfaces, yielding concrete lower bounds (e.g., at least 4 genus-2 minimal surfaces in (S^3) with ( \operatorname{Ric}&gt;0 )). Both directly intersect variational min-max techniques central to your work.

<h3>Allen–Cahn and phase-transition analogues of minimal surfaces</h3>
<p>An Allen–Cahn analogue of the strong maximum principle for minimal hypersurfaces: for entire solutions whose nodal sets are asymptotic to a regular minimizing hypercone, inclusion of the positive phases enforces a global ordering and uniqueness determined by the positive phase. The maximum principle for the linearized operator on rough, unbounded domains is technically notable and relevant for the Allen–Cahn/minimal-surface correspondence near cones and for uniqueness/rigidity issues of entire solutions approximating minimal cones.

<h3>Minimal currents in hyperbolic space: boundary regularity at infinity</h3>
<p>Advances asymptotic theory for high-codimension area-minimizing currents in ( \mathbb{H}^n ), giving “boundary regularity at infinity” near the asymptotic boundary (in the Euclidean compactification). It also identifies intrinsic obstructions to higher-order regularity for odd-dimensional minimal surfaces depending on the geometry of the boundary at infinity. This directly interfaces with GMT and minimal surfaces in hyperbolic manifolds, aligning with your interest in hyperbolic 3-manifolds and beyond.

<h3>Curvature flows and regularization of singular evolutions</h3>
<p>A fourth-order elastica-type regularization of curve-shortening flow with Dirichlet boundary conditions is shown to converge smoothly, as ( \varepsilon\to 0^{+} ), to the classical curvature flow up to the first singular time. This provides a robust approximation scheme for curvature-driven evolutions with boundaries, conceptually akin to phase-field regularizations (e.g., Allen–Cahn) used for mean curvature flow, and is potentially useful for both analysis and computation before singularity formation.

<h2>Medium Interest Papers</h2>
<h3>Rigorous numerics for parabolic PDEs and potential applications to phase-field flows</h3>
<p>A simple a posteriori rigorous integrator for semilinear parabolic PDEs provides explicit error bounds over long times via a piecewise-in-time constant linearization and adaptive time stepping. While demonstrated on Swift–Hohenberg, Ohta–Kawasaki, and Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, the methodology is promising for certifying Allen–Cahn dynamics and convergence to equilibria, complementing computational approaches to geometric flows.

<h3>Geometric flows beyond MCF: stability and constructive methods</h3>
<p>One paper establishes dynamic stability for Donaldson’s hyperkähler flow of surfaces, extending Wang–Tsai’s (C^1) stability results for mean curvature flow near minimal surfaces; another constructs the ( \lambda )-Angenent curve using a modified curve-shortening flow rather than shooting. Both contribute techniques for stability analysis and constructive flow-based existence in settings adjacent to MCF.

* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02853v1">Constructing (λ)-Angenent curve by flow method</a> by Pak Tung Ho</p>
<h3>Variational problems on submanifolds: biharmonic conformal hypersurfaces</h3>
<p>Derives the biharmonic equation for conformal hypersurfaces and obtains rigidity/nonexistence results in space forms, with a link to isoparametric functions in the totally umbilic case. While not minimal, the variational framework and curvature identities may inform higher-order models and constraints on submanifold geometry.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03462v1">On biharmonic conformal hypersurfaces</a> by A. Mohammed Cherif, Ye-Lin Ou</p>
<h3>Regularized optimal transport: uniform regularity and sparsity</h3>
<p>Proves interior (C^{0,1})/(C^1) regularity for transport-like maps and (C^{1,1-})/(C^2) regularity for potentials with estimates uniform in the regularization parameter (including entropic and subquadratic cases), plus sharp support-size bounds. These tools contribute to the broader calculus of variations and may inform Wasserstein-gradient-flow approximations in geometric PDE contexts.

<h3>Nonlocal nonlinear PDE with critical growth</h3>
<p>Establishes existence and concentration of ground states for a mixed local–nonlocal Choquard equation in ( \mathbb{R}^2 ) with Trudinger–Moser critical growth:
[
-\varepsilon^{2}\Delta u+\varepsilon^{2s}(-\Delta)^{s}u+V(x)u
=\varepsilon^{\mu-2}\left(\frac{1}{|x|^\mu}*F(u)\right)f(u).
]
Methodologically relevant for handling critical growth, nonlocal interactions, and concentration phenomena in variational PDEs.
