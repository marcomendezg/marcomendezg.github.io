    <p>Weekly highlights in geometric analysis</p>
<p>Mean curvature and curve-shortening flows
- Sun: For closed immersed curves in R^n whose orthogonal projection to some 2-plane is injective and convex, curve-shortening flow develops a Type I singularity and becomes asymptotically circular. As an application, any closed immersed curve in R^n can be perturbed in R^{n+2} to shrink to a round point, giving an analog of Huisken’s round-point conjecture for curves. This adds a robust geometric hypothesis (convex planar projection) guaranteeing canonical blow-up and round asymptotics in higher codimension.
- Huang: Constructs mean curvature flows that, after Type I rescaling, converge to a strictly stable, area-minimizing hypercone C, and after Type II rescaling converge to the Hardt–Simon foliation of C, removing symmetry assumptions from Velázquez’s earlier constructions. This provides new, symmetry-free models for approach to singular minimizing cones and their foliations, clarifying singularity profiles and stability.
- Langford–McCoy: Localizes umbilic, convexity, and cylindrical pinching estimates to fully nonlinear flows by one-homogeneous speeds, adapting localized Huisken–Stampacchia iteration. The method works in Euclidean space and extends to curved ambient manifolds, sharpening tools for blow-up and surgery in fully nonlinear geometric flows.</p>
<p>Varifolds and weak-to-strong upgrades
- Motegi: If a graphical Brakke flow has L^2 normal velocity and the graph has C^0 in space with C^0 spatial gradient, then the graph admits weak derivatives with ∂_t f, ∇^2 f ∈ L^2, and the Brakke velocity matches the classical normal velocity. With forcing in L^{p,q} (resp. C^{0,α}), the flow is a strong (resp. classical) solution of forced MCF. This bridges GMT formulations with PDE regularity, strengthening weak–strong consistency for graphical flows.</p>
<p>Minimal surfaces: structure, stability, and deformations
- Pérez (survey): A comprehensive account of the Meeks–Pérez–Ros program on complete, properly embedded minimal surfaces in R^3, including the genus-zero infinite-topology classification, lamination techniques (limit-leaf stability, removable singularities, singular structure), the dynamics theorem, index/topology bounds for finite total curvature, and the embedded Calabi–Yau problem for finite genus. A valuable roadmap with open problems.
- Gianocca: Explores the gap between energy index and first Laplace eigenvalue for minimal surfaces in spheres. If λ_1(Σ) &lt; 1/6 in S^3, there exists a normal variation orthogonal to Möbius fields with negative second variation; extends to S^n with threshold λ_1(Σ) &lt; (n−2)/(2n). This offers a partial converse to classical index bounds and refines spectral–stability relations.
- Sonnet–Virga: Classifies neutral deformation modes taking minimal surfaces to minimal surfaces within a thin-shell energy framework: stretching-neutral ⇒ drilling-neutral ⇒ bending-neutral; isometries are globally neutral. Provides an energy-based hierarchy that dovetails with geometric stability notions.</p>
<p>Isoparametric geometry and area-minimizing cones
- Cui: Introduces a new isoparametric foliation on S^n×S^n (from restricting FKM foliations) and, via Lawlor’s curvature criterion, produces many new area-minimizing cones, notably codimension-2 minimizing cones in R^{2n+2} for n≥63. These supply fresh singular models and potential tangent cones for variational problems and flows, and extend Urbano’s classification in low dimension.</p>
<p>Surfaces with prescribed curvature
- Skopenkov–Yorov: Constructs families of surfaces with constant ratio of principal curvatures (CRPC) passing through a given non-flat minimal surface and gives a partial Plateau theory for CRPC, with parallel results in isotropic geometry via successive approximations and analytic majorization. This generalizes minimal-surface existence paradigms to a broader curvature class.
- Ferro–Corro: Local classification of surfaces and hypersurfaces determined by prescribed radial mean curvature (in terms of height/angle data). Introduces a class of 3D hypersurfaces with vanishing second mean curvature and a recursive construction scheme, with extensions to higher dimensions.</p>
<p>Harmonic coordinates and weak immersions
- Martino–Rivière: In even dimensions n≥4, any weak immersion in W^{n/2+1,2}(R^n;R^d) with small second fundamental form in W^{n/2−1,2} admits global harmonic coordinates, generalizing Müller–Šverák (n=2). Intrinsically, metrics with Riemann curvature in L^p, p&gt;n/2, admit local harmonic coordinates. These are key for scale-invariant Lagrangians (e.g., Graham–Reichert) and for fine regularity/blow-up analyses in critical regimes.</p>
<p>Homogeneous and symmetric spaces
- Li–Tamaru–Yao: Classification of Hopf hypersurfaces in the complex hyperbolic quadric Q^{m*} with constant principal curvatures: full classification with at most two eigenvalues; for three/four eigenvalues, determination of possible values and multiplicities. Advances the catalog of homogeneous-type hypersurfaces in rank-one symmetric spaces.</p>
<p>Rigidity and linearized geometry
- Butt–Erchenko–Humbert–Lefeuvre–Wilkinson: Define the marked Poincaré determinant (MPD) measuring unstable volume expansion along closed geodesics. In dimension 3, near a hyperbolic metric, equality of MPD implies homothety, yielding a local marked rigidity. A by-product is injectivity of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on TT-tensors at the hyperbolic metric—new in negative curvature—with implications for the linearized Einstein operator and local metric rigidity.</p>
<p>Relativity and kinetic matter
- Athanasiou–Mondal–Yau: Large-data, no-symmetry semi-global existence and trapped-surface formation for the Einstein–massless Vlasov system. The proof uses a hierarchy of estimates for Weyl curvature, Ricci coefficients, and velocity moments, a renormalization of Ricci coefficients, minimal elliptic inputs, and a commutator calculus on the mass shell. First construction of dynamical black holes with kinetic matter without symmetry; techniques may inform stability and dispersive analyses in geometric PDE.</p>
<p>Phase-field models
- Gatti–Ipocoana–Miranville: A non-isothermal Allen–Cahn tumor growth model derived via microforces, with local and global well-posedness. While application-driven, the coupling of Allen–Cahn with temperature adds a tractable PDE system relevant to phase-field/variational flows.</p>
<p>Big-picture themes
- Toward canonical singularity models: new mechanisms ensuring Type I blow-up and round-point formation for curves in higher codimension; constructions of MCFs converging to minimizing cones and their foliations without symmetry.
- Sharper analytical frameworks for weak objects: converting Brakke flows with L^2 velocity into strong/classical graphical solutions; harmonic coordinates at critical regularity for immersions and low-regularity metrics.
- New singular geometries and rigidity: proliferation of area-minimizing cones from isoparametric foliations; spectral thresholds linking eigenvalues to instability on minimal surfaces in spheres; rigidity invariants for negatively curved metrics and linearized injectivity results.</p>
<p>Potential directions/questions
- Can Sun’s convex-projection hypothesis be relaxed (e.g., quantitative almost-convexity) while retaining Type I and asymptotic circularity?
- Do Huang’s symmetry-free constructions yield basin-of-attraction results for flows near a given stable cone C, or produce new ancient solutions?
- How far do Langford–McCoy’s localized pinching estimates extend to non one-homogeneous speeds or anisotropic flows, and to ambient curvature with lower regularity?
- Can Motegi’s weak-to-strong upgrade be adapted beyond graphs (e.g., multi-valued or small Lipschitz varifolds) or used to prove weak–strong uniqueness?
- In the isoparametric-cone setting, do the new cones appear as tangent flows to MCF in high dimensions, and do they impose new dimension thresholds for regularity?</p>
