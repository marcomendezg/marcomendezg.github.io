    <h3>Mean Curvature Flow, Allen–Cahn, and Non-uniqueness</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06979v2">Non-uniqueness in Mean Curvature Flow: Non-canonical solutions via the parabolic Allen--Cahn</a> by J. M. Daniels-Holgate</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09383v2">Existence of martingale solutions for a stochastic weighted mean   curvature flow of graphs</a> by Qi Yan, Xiang-Dong Li</li>
</ul>
<p>These papers push the Allen–Cahn/MCF interface in two directions central to variational approximations of minimal hypersurfaces and flows. Daniels-Holgate constructs the first closed, non-canonical integral Brakke motions supported strictly inside fattening, by taking limits of parabolic ( \varepsilon )-Allen–Cahn—opening a new landscape of weak-flow selection beyond outermost flows and validating Allen–Cahn as a flexible generator of weak MCFs from rough sets. Yan–Li establish martingale solutions for a stochastic weighted graphical MCF and a small-noise limit, giving a framework for incorporating randomness into curvature-driven evolution that remains variational in flavor.</p>
<h3>Inverse and Gauss Curvature Flows: Ancient, Anisotropic, and 1D Models</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08168v1">Asymptotic behaviour of the weak inverse anisotropic mean curvature flow</a> by Chaoqun Gao, Yong Wei, Rong Zhou</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05614v1">Ancient Gauss Curvature Flows of Bounded Width</a> by Beomjun Choi, Kyeongsu Choi, Dongjun Noh</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04566v1">Inverse curvature flow of closed Legendre curves</a> by Takashi Kagaya, Masatomo Takahashi</li>
</ul>
<p>Gao–Wei–Zhou obtain (p)-harmonic gradient estimates uniform as (p\to 1), yielding control for weak inverse anisotropic MCF and proving asymptotics to expanding Wulff shapes—an anisotropic extension of Huisken–Ilmanen with tools that dovetail with variational methods for anisotropic minimal surfaces. The Choi–Choi–Noh ancient solutions (pancake and sausage types) offer new models for singularity formation in Gauss curvature flow, useful as barriers/test cases in classification programs. Kagaya–Takahashi’s inverse curvature flow for Legendre curves, with monotonic cusp-count and convergence to self-similar limits, provides a clean 1D testbed for inverse-flow techniques that often inform higher-dimensional arguments.</p>
<h3>Geometric Measure Theory for Limits and Structures on Varifolds</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08360v1">The Space-Time Connectivity Theorem for Normal Currents</a> by Paolo Bonicatto, Filip Rindler, Harry Turnbull</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05639v1">Young functions on varifolds. Part I. Functional analytic foundations</a> by Hsin-Chuang Chou</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonicatto–Rindler–Turnbull’s space-time normal current realizes weak* convergence of normal currents via a connecting current in time, furnishing a “dynamic” deformation witnessing convergence—promising for tracking variational/Brakke limits and building homotopies between approximating cycles in min–max. Chou develops a functional-analytic setting for “Young functions” on varifolds via graph measures, giving compactness for pairs (surface, function) and setting up differentiability notions—relevant for coupling geometric objects with phase fields or multivalued data in Allen–Cahn and GL frameworks.</p>
<h3>Free Boundaries, Optimal Partitions, and Fracture</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09875v1">Vectorial Bernoulli Problems and Free Boundary Systems</a> by Giorgio Tortone, Bozhidar Velichkov</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08241v1">A survey on the optimal partition problem</a> by Roberto Ognibene, Bozhidar Velichkov</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08670v1">Hausdorff dimension of the singular set for Griffith almost-minimizers   in the plane</a> by Manuel Friedrich, Camille Labourie, Kerrek Stinson</li>
</ul>
<p>These works consolidate and advance free-boundary regularity theory aligned with minimal-partition geometry. The surveys map techniques and open problems for vectorial Bernoulli and optimal partitions—natural companions to multi-phase minimal surfaces. Friedrich–Labourie–Stinson prove uniform rectifiability of cracks and that the singular set has Hausdorff dimension (&lt;1) for (almost-)minimizers of Griffith’s energy, alongside higher integrability—parallel to Mumford–Shah and echoing De Giorgi-type conjectures, with clear implications for GMT methods in free-discontinuity problems.</p>
<h3>Variational Calculus: Relaxation, Nonlocal-to-Local Limits, and Phase-Fields</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07085v1">Relaxation of Non-Convex Integral Functionals in the Multidimensional   Scalar Case</a> by Tommaso Bertin, Paulin Huguet</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04881v1">Riesz fractional gradient functionals defined on partitions:   nonlocal-to-local variational limits</a> by Stefano Almi, Maicol Caponi, Manuel Friedrich, Francesco Solombrino</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08287v1">On the Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonlinear diffusion: the non-convex   case</a> by Monica Conti, Stefania Gatti, Andrea Giorgini, Giulio Schimperna</li>
</ul>
<p>Bertin–Huguet characterize the lower-semicontinuous envelope of general non-convex functionals (E[u]=\int_\Omega f(x,u,\nabla u)\,dx) under fixed Lipschitz boundary data, informing relaxation in min–max and phase-transition models. Almi–Caponi–Friedrich–Solombrino obtain ( \Gamma )-limits as (s\to 1) for Riesz-gradient energies on partitions, clarifying nonlocal-to-local passage that underlies fractional approximations of interfacial energies. Conti–Gatti–Giorgini–Schimperna analyze non-convex Cahn–Hilliard with nonlinear diffusion, proving uniqueness in 2D, conditional/global well-posedness in 3D, and convergence to equilibrium via a tailored Łojasiewicz–Simon inequality—useful for gradient-flow stability of diffuse-interface models approximating area.</p>
<h3>Isoperimetry and Multi-Bubble Stability</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07078v1">Multi-Bubble Isoperimetric Problems</a> by Emanuel Milman</li>
</ul>
<p>A survey of multi-bubble minimizers and quantitative stability for “soap-bubble” partitions. The stability/structure theory here is tightly connected to minimal surface partitions and may inform higher-parameter min–max constructions and stability inequalities for stationary multi-phase interfaces.</p>
<h3>Minimal Surfaces and Comparison Geometry</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04481v1">Minimal surfaces and comparison geometry</a> by Otis Chodosh</li>
</ul>
<p>An up-to-date perspective on leveraging minimal surfaces for comparison-geometry problems. This aligns directly with min–max and regularity tools, with potential methodological crossovers to scalar curvature and rigidity via area-minimization and sweepouts.</p>
<h3>Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds: Volume and Boundary Data</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05627v1">Volume functions and boundary data of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds</a> by Jean-Marc Schlenker</li>
</ul>
<p>A survey of renormalized volumes and boundary data, emphasizing first-variation formulas where conjugate boundary variables appear. The variational structure connects to minimal/CMC surfaces in convex cores and suggests fertile ground for applying surface-variation techniques within hyperbolic 3-geometry.</p>
<h3>Willmore/Fenchel Inequalities and Sobolev-Type Estimates on Submanifolds</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08053v1">Fenchel-Willmore and Sobolev-type inequalities for submanifolds in   non-negatively curved manifolds</a> by Meng Ji, Kwok-Kun Kwong</li>
</ul>
<p>Links between Fenchel–Willmore-type energies and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for mean-convex submanifolds are established, with extensions to boundaries and non-compact settings. These sharpened inequalities bear on secondary interests (Willmore/variational inequalities) and may yield new constraints for curvature concentration and topology of surfaces.</p>
<p>Notes:
- Several results above interface directly with min–max and diffuse-interface methods for constructing/approximating minimal hypersurfaces: Allen–Cahn flow limits, ( \Gamma )-convergence as (s\to 1), and relaxation theorems.
- Flow papers provide new ancient/prototypical solutions and asymptotics that can serve as models or barriers in singularity analysis and geometric measure theory approaches to curvature flows.</p>
