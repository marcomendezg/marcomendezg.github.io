    <h3>Mean curvature flow, Allen–Cahn approximations, and stochastic/weak solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09383v2">Existence of martingale solutions for a stochastic weighted mean curvature flow of graphs</a> by Qi Yan, Xiang-Dong Li  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06979v2">Non-uniqueness in Mean Curvature Flow: Non-canonical solutions via the parabolic Allen--Cahn</a> by J. M. Daniels-Holgate</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters for you: both papers bear directly on weak/variational notions of MCF that you study. Daniels-Holgate constructs non-outermost Brakke motions as limits of the parabolic $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn flow, producing the first closed, nontrivial integral Brakke motions supported strictly inside fattening regions — a new class of examples relevant to questions about uniqueness, fattening, and $\varepsilon$-approximation schemes. Yan–Li develop existence of martingale solutions for stochastic weighted MCF of graphs (variational SPDE compactness methods) and study small-noise limits; this connects stochastic perturbations of mean curvature flow with probabilistic/variational compactness and could interplay with probabilistic selection principles for weak flows.</p>
<p>Relevant techniques/keywords to note: $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn limits to Brakke motions, low-regularity initial data (fractal/Reifenberg sets), variational SPDE compactness, martingale solutions, selection/non-uniqueness phenomena.</p>

<h3>Curvature flows: Gauss curvature, inverse (anisotropic) flows, inverse curvature of Legendre curves, Hermitian curvature flow</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05614v1">Ancient Gauss Curvature Flows of Bounded Width</a> by Beomjun Choi, Kyeongsu Choi, Dongjun Noh  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08168v1">Asymptotic behaviour of the weak inverse anisotropic mean curvature flow</a> by Chaoqun Gao, Yong Wei, Rong Zhou  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04566v1">Inverse curvature flow of closed Legendre curves</a> by Takashi Kagaya, Masatomo Takahashi  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08846v1">Positive Hermitian curvature flow on 2-step nilpotent Lie groups</a> by Ettore Lo Giudice</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters for you: these works extend existence/asymptotic classifications in several curvature-flow directions you follow. Choi–Choi–Noh construct new ancient solutions (pancake/sausage type) for Gauss/$\alpha$-Gauss curvature flows — examples that illuminate singularity profiles and ancient-solution rigidity. Gao–Wei–Zhou obtain uniform gradient estimates stable as $p\to1$, passing to the weak inverse anisotropic mean curvature flow (IAMCF) and proving asymptotic convergence to Wulff shapes, generalizing Huisken–Ilmanen to anisotropic settings (useful if you consider anisotropic variational structures). Kagaya–Takahashi treat inverse curvature flow for Legendre curves, giving global existence, cusp monotonicity, and classification of scaling limits (self-similar attractors). Lo Giudice analyzes Hermitian curvature flow on 2-step nilpotent Lie groups and long-time behavior / solitons — relevant if you track geometric flows beyond hypersurfaces and are interested in soliton uniqueness up to homothety.</p>
<p>Techniques: gradient estimates uniform in limits ($p\to1$), barrier/asymptotic analysis to Wulff shapes, ancient-solution constructions, classification via rescaling, Cheeger–Gromov limits for long-time behavior.</p>

<h3>Geometric measure theory, varifolds, space–time currents, and free-boundary systems</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08360v1">The Space-Time Connectivity Theorem for Normal Currents</a> by Paolo Bonicatto, Filip Rindler, Harry Turnbull  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05639v1">Young functions on varifolds. Part I. Functional analytic foundations</a> by Hsin-Chuang Chou  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09875v1">Vectorial Bernoulli Problems and Free Boundary Systems</a> by Giorgio Tortone, Bozhidar Velichkov  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08670v1">Hausdorff dimension of the singular set for Griffith almost-minimizers in the plane</a> by Manuel Friedrich, Camille Labourie, Kerrek Stinson  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08241v1">A survey on the optimal partition problem</a> by Roberto Ognibene, Bozhidar Velichkov</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters for you: these papers push the analytic/measure-theoretic machinery you rely on. Bonicatto–Rindler–Turnbull give a space–time variant of connectivity for normal currents that produces a time-coordinate connecting sequence elements to the limit — a potentially useful framework when passing to limits of time-evolving varifolds/Brakke flows or when constructing deformation currents in min–max continuity arguments. Chou develops a functional-analytic foundation for Young functions on varifolds (a multiple-valued / measure-theoretic model) and compactness via associated graph measures — directly relevant to convergence of surfaces together with scalar fields (e.g., phase-field approximations like Allen–Cahn). Tortone–Velichkov and Ognibene–Velichkov survey vectorial Bernoulli/free-boundary systems and optimal partition regularity — central for multi-component variational problems and free-boundary regularity techniques. Friedrich–Labourie–Stinson lower the Hausdorff dimension of Griffith fracture singular sets (uniform rectifiability, ε-regularity), an advance in singular-set size estimates analogous to results for Mumford–Shah and related variational fracture models.</p>
<p>Techniques/keywords: space–time normal currents, weak* convergence, graph-measure compactness for varifolds+functions, ε-regularity and uniform rectifiability, multi-phase free-boundary systems, monotonicity and dimension estimates.</p>

<h3>Relaxation, non-convex variational problems, and nonlocal-to-local limits</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07085v1">Relaxation of Non-Convex Integral Functionals in the Multidimensional Scalar Case</a> by Tommaso Bertin, Paulin Huguet  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04672v1">Relaxation of quasi-convex functionals with variable exponent growth</a> by Giacomo Bertazzoni, Petteri Harjulehto, Peter Hästö, Elvira Zappale  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04881v1">Riesz fractional gradient functionals defined on partitions: nonlocal-to-local variational limits</a> by Stefano Almi, Maicol Caponi, Manuel Friedrich, Francesco Solombrino</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters for you: these papers refine the variational foundations that underpin many approximations and min–max constructions. Bertin–Huguet and Bertazzoni et al. give lower-semicontinuous envelopes / relaxation frameworks for non-convex and variable-exponent integrands (important where Lavrentiev phenomena or variable-growth energies appear). Almi–et al. analyze $\Gamma$-limits of Riesz $s$-fractional gradient energies on piecewise-constant partitions as $s\to1$, clarifying nonlocal-to-local transitions — directly relevant when comparing nonlocal phase-field or fractional-perimeter approximations to classical geometric energies.</p>
<p>Keywords: relaxation, lower semicontinuity, Lavrentiev gap, $\Gamma$-convergence, nonlocal-to-local limits, variable exponent growth.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Phase-field, gradient-flow PDEs, and long-time dynamics</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08287v1">On the Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonlinear diffusion: the non-convex case</a> by Monica Conti, Stefania Gatti, Andrea Giorgini, Giulio Schimperna  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07149v1">Derivation of the fourth-order DLSS equation with nonlinear mobility via chemical reactions</a> by Alexander Mielke, André Schlichting, Artur Stephan</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters for you: both papers emphasize gradient-structure, long-time behavior, and justification of higher-order PDEs arising as variational limits. Conti–Gatti–Giorgini–Schimperna remove convexity assumptions for nonlinear-diffusion Cahn–Hilliard, prove uniqueness/smoothing in 2D and obtain convergence to equilibria using a tailored Lojasiewicz–Simon inequality — a method you may use in analyzing phase-field approximations of minimal surfaces. Mielke–et al. derive a fourth-order DLSS equation (and nonlinear-mobility variants) from particle/chemical reaction models and identify the limiting gradient structure via EDP convergence; this clarifies when higher-order gradient flows approximate diffusive/phase-separation dynamics and shows qualitative behaviors (traveling waves with algebraic tails, compact support) that might inform approximation strategies.</p>
<p>Techniques/keywords: Lojasiewicz–Simon inequality, EDP convergence, gradient structures, nonlinear mobility, higher-order PDE limits.</p>

<h3>Minimal surfaces, comparison geometry, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and geometric inequalities</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04481v1">Minimal surfaces and comparison geometry</a> by Otis Chodosh  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05627v1">Volume functions and boundary data of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds</a> by Jean-Marc Schlenker  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08053v1">Fenchel-Willmore and Sobolev-type inequalities for submanifolds in non-negatively curved manifolds</a> by Meng Ji, Kwok-Kun Kwong</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters for you: Chodosh’s note collects applications of minimal-surface theory to comparison geometry — likely to contain useful perspectives or technical lemmas (stability, curvature bounds) you can reuse. Schlenker’s survey on boundary data vs. volume functions (renormalized volume, convex cores) ties directly to your interest in hyperbolic 3-manifolds and interactions between boundary geometric data and interior geometric functionals. Ji–Kwong connect Fenchel–Willmore inequalities to logarithmic Sobolev-type inequalities and derive Sobolev-type estimates for mean-convex submanifolds; such inequalities influence concentration/compactness and stability analyses for variational problems (Willmore/area) and can yield topological consequences in surface cases.</p>
<p>Keywords: renormalized volume, boundary conjugate data, Willmore-type inequalities, Sobolev inequalities on submanifolds.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Isoperimetric partitions and multi-bubble stability</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07078v1">Multi-Bubble Isoperimetric Problems</a> by Emanuel Milman</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters for you: Milman surveys structural characterization and stability for multi-bubble minimizers (soap-bubble partitions). This directly overlaps with your interests in variational partition problems, free-boundary regularity, and stability estimates for minimisers; it also connects to optimal-partition questions and applications of GMT/second-variation techniques.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Secondary / adjacent items (possible crossovers)</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05732v1">A contractible Schiffer counterexample on the half-sphere</a> by Gonzalo Cao-Labora, Antonio J. Fernández  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04821v1">Geometric Mechanics of Thin Periodic Surfaces</a> by Wenqian Sun, Yanxin Feng, Christian D. Santangelo, D. Zeb Rocklin  </li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04442v1">The moduli spaces of left-invariant statistical structures on Lie groups</a> by Hikozo Kobayashi, Yu Ohno, Takayuki Okuda, Hiroshi Tamaru</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters for you: these are more peripheral to your core program but may be of occasional interest. The Schiffer counterexample uses bifurcation + computer-assisted verification in spectral geometry (useful mindset for variational bifurcation problems). The thin-surface mechanics paper offers geometric constraints linking isometries and stresses that could intersect with rigidity or bending energy problems. The moduli-space paper is primarily information-geometric; include it only if you track Lie-group examples of geometric flows or invariant variational structures.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can:
- Extract specific lemmas/estimates from any of the above papers (e.g., the uniform $p\to1$ gradient bound in the IAMCF paper, or the space–time connectivity statement) that may be directly useful for your work; or
- Sketch how the $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn constructions from Daniels-Holgate might be adapted to produce specific non-outermost Brakke motions in examples you care about.</p>
