    <h3>Mean curvature flow: singularities, estimates, and weak-to-strong regularity</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14863v1">Singularities of Curve Shortening Flow with Convex Projections</a> by Qi Sun</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12037v1">Local umbilic, convexity and cylindrical estimates for fully nonlinear curvature flows</a> by Mat Langford, James McCoy</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11377v1">$L^2$ normal velocity implies strong solution for graphical Brakke flows</a> by Kotaro Motegi</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11430v1">Mean curvature flow converging to an minimizing cone and its Hardt-Simon foliation</a> by Jiuzhou Huang</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Sun proves that closed immersed curves in (\mathbb{R}^n) with a convex one-to-one planar projection develop Type I singularities (asymptotically circular blow-ups), and gives a perturbative route to round-point extinction in higher codimension—useful for understanding blow-up models and genericity in curve MCF. Langford–McCoy localize Huisken–Stampacchia to obtain sharp pinching (umbilic/convexity/cylindrical) estimates for broad one-homogeneous fully nonlinear flows; these localized inequalities are directly applicable in neck/improvement-of-convexity analyses akin to MCF. Motegi shows that graphical Brakke flows with (L^2) normal velocity become strong solutions with (\partial_t f, \nabla^2 f \in L^2), upgrading varifold-level information to classical regularity under mild assumptions—valuable for bridging GMT and PDE approaches to MCF with forcing. Huang constructs flows converging (after Type I rescaling) to strictly stable area-minimizing cones (\mathcal{C}) and, after Type II rescaling, to the Hardt–Simon foliation, without symmetry hypotheses; this connects MCF dynamics to calibrations and the singular foliation structure around minimizing cones, relevant for min–max blow-up analysis and tangent flow classification.</p>
<h3>Minimal surfaces: structure, index, and deformation modes</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12319v1">Minimal Surfaces of Finite Genus: Classification, Dynamics and Laminations</a> by Joaquín Pérez</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11811v1">Note on energy index and first eigenvalue of minimal surfaces in spheres</a> by Matilde Gianocca</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12987v1">Neutral Deformation Modes of Minimal Surfaces</a> by Ande M. Sonnet, Epifanio G. Virga</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Pérez’s ICM-style survey distills three decades of the Meeks–Pérez–Ros program: lamination techniques (limit-leaf stability, removable singularity theorems), dynamics, and classification for properly embedded minimal surfaces in (\mathbb{R}^3), with sharp topology/index bounds and moduli-space insights—excellent context for min–max outputs and singularity analysis. Gianocca links the energy index to the first Laplace–Beltrami eigenvalue on minimal surfaces in (S^n): if (\lambda_1(\Sigma) &lt; \frac{n-2}{2n}), there is a normal variation orthogonal to the (n+1) Möbius fields with negative second variation, refining how spectral gaps force instability—useful for index bounds in min–max applications. Sonnet–Virga classify “neutral” deformation modes mapping minimal surfaces to minimal surfaces and establish a hierarchy (isometric ⇒ drilling-neutral ⇒ bending-neutral), offering a closed-form energetic decomposition of soft directions of the Jacobi operator (L); this informs stability and elastic responses in families arising from variational constructions.</p>
<h3>Area-minimizing cones and isoparametric geometry</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14650v1">On FKM isoparametric hypersurfaces in (\mathbb{S}^n \times \mathbb{S}^n)   and new area-minimizing cones</a> by Hongbin Cui</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Using an FKM-derived isoparametric foliation restricted to (\mathbb{S}^n(a)\times \mathbb{S}^n(b)), Cui applies Lawlor’s curvature criterion to produce many new area-minimizing cones, including codimension-two cones in (\mathbb{R}^{2n+2}) for (n\ge 63). Such strictly stable cones are central as singularity models and barriers in min–max and MCF analysis; they also enrich the landscape where Hardt–Simon foliations and calibrated geometry techniques apply.</p>
<h3>Prescribed curvature and generalizations of minimal/CMC geometry</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14527v1">Families of surfaces with constant ratio of principal curvatures and   Plateau's problem</a> by Mikhail Skopenkov, Khusrav Yorov</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11669v1">Surfaces and Hypersurfaces with Prescribed Radial Mean Curvature</a> by Marcelo Lopes Ferro, Armando M. V. Corro</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12284v1">On Hopf hypersurfaces of the complex hyperbolic quadric with constant   principal curvatures</a> by Haizhong Li, Hiroshi Tamaru, Zeke Yao</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Skopenkov–Yorov construct families of surfaces with constant ratio (k_1/k_2=\text{const}) containing a given minimal surface and give a partial Plateau theory for these CRPC surfaces; this extends the minimal/CMC paradigm and suggests new boundary-value frameworks near (H=0). Lopes Ferro–Corro develop a local classification for surfaces/hypersurfaces with prescribed “radial” mean curvature and for hypersurfaces with vanishing second mean curvature, together with a recursive construction scheme—tools relevant to capillarity-type prescribed curvature problems. Li–Tamaru–Yao classify Hopf hypersurfaces with constant principal curvatures in the complex hyperbolic quadric (Q^{m*}), adding to the catalog of homogeneous constant-curvature models that often serve as comparison or barrier geometries in curvature problems.</p>
<h3>Phase-field methods and curvature-penalized interfacial energies</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13283v1">An Allen-Cahn tumor growth model with temperature</a> by Stefania Gatti, Erica Ipocoana, Alain Miranville</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13275v1">Curvature penalization of strongly anisotropic interfaces models and   their phase-field approximation</a> by Jean-François Babadjian, Blanche Buet, Michael Goldman</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Gatti–Ipocoana–Miranville introduce and prove well-posedness for a non-isothermal Allen–Cahn/Ginzburg–Landau system; while applied, the analysis clarifies coupled reaction–diffusion dynamics pertinent to phase-field approximations of mean-curvature-driven interfaces. Babadjian–Buet–Goldman study strongly anisotropic surface energies where nonconvexity in the normal causes instability; adding a Willmore-type curvature term restores lower semicontinuity and yields (\Gamma)-limits via phase-field approximations, even allowing singularities like crack tips and multi-junctions—techniques that resonate with anisotropic mean curvature and Allen–Cahn approximations of curvature-dependent energies.</p>
<h3>Hyperbolic 3-manifolds: rigidity via periodic orbit data</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11399v1">Marked Poincaré rigidity near hyperbolic metrics and injectivity of   the Lichnerowicz Laplacian in dimension 3</a> by Karen Butt, Alena Erchenko, Tristan Humbert, Thibault Lefeuvre, Amie Wilkinson</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: The marked Poincaré determinant (unstable Jacobian along closed geodesics) rigidifies metrics near hyperbolic ones in dimension 3: equality of MPD implies homothety. They also prove injectivity of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on trace-free divergence-free 2-tensors for hyperbolic metrics. Such rigidity and linear elliptic injectivity can inform uniqueness and deformation theories where minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds are used as geometric probes, potentially constraining ambient deformations through Jacobi field control.</p>
<h3>Variational models and inequalities (secondary)</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11893v1">Non-spherical minimizers in the generalized liquid drop model for Yukawa   and truncated Coulomb potentials</a> by Lia Bronsard, Benoît Merlet, Marc Pegon</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11662v1">A family of interaction energy minimizers supported on two intervals</a> by Steven B. Damelin, Ruiwen Shu</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12631v1">Isoperimetric Bounds for Weighted Steklov Eigenvalues with Radial   Weights</a> by Friedemann Brock, Francesco Chiacchio</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14476v1">An (L^\infty)-variational problem involving the Fractional Laplacian</a> by Simone Carano, Roger Moser</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentary: Bronsard–Merlet–Pegon show screened interactions yield non-spherical minimizers by energy-per-mass comparisons, informing shape-optimization heuristics relevant to geometric variational problems. Damelin–Shu develop an iterated balayage method beyond logarithmic potentials to pin down multi-interval supports—techniques that may generalize to (\mathbb{R}^d). Brock–Chiacchio extend Weinstock-type isoperimetric inequalities to weighted Steklov problems via radial spectra and double-density inequalities. Carano–Moser establish existence/uniqueness of absolute minimizers for the supremal fractional seminorm (E_\infty(u)=\|(-\Delta)^s u\|_{L^\infty}) with a PDE characterization; while peripheral, these methods enrich the calculus of variations toolbox potentially applicable to nonlocal regularization and limit energies.</p>
